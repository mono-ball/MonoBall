[INTRO - 0:00-0:08]
(Neon synth build, electric guitar feedback)

[VERSE 1 - 0:08-0:32]
Neon signs flicker in the dead of night
Circuit boards pulse with toxic light
Steel and chrome, we're locked in this fight
Your poison type won't make me run and hide

I've been training in the digital rain
Breaking through the static, feeling the pain
Every glitch, every error, every strain
Has brought me here to claim my name

[PRE-CHORUS - 0:32-0:40]
Heartbeat syncs with the city's hum
Adrenaline rush, here we come
No turning back, the battle's begun
In this toxic duel, only one will overcome

[CHORUS - 0:40-1:00]
Toxic duel, in the cyber light
Clashing forces, burning bright
Poison in the air, sparks ignite
Only one will stand when the circuits die
Toxic duel, we're fighting for our lives
In this neon world where the strong survive
Every move calculated, every strike precise
In this toxic duel, we test our might

[VERSE 2 - 1:00-1:24]
Glitching screens show our every move
Digital arenas where we prove
That we're more than what they thought we'd be
Breaking chains, finally free

Your cybernetic creatures, power in their veins
But I've got something you can't contain
A fire that burns through all the pain
And I won't stop until I've won this game

[PRE-CHORUS - 1:24-1:32]
Heartbeat syncs with the city's hum
Adrenaline rush, here we come
No turning back, the battle's begun
In this toxic duel, only one will overcome

[CHORUS - 1:32-1:52]
Toxic duel, in the cyber light
Clashing forces, burning bright
Poison in the air, sparks ignite
Only one will stand when the circuits die
Toxic duel, we're fighting for our lives
In this neon world where the strong survive
Every move calculated, every strike precise
In this toxic duel, we test our might

[BRIDGE - 1:52-2:12]
Electric tension rising, can't escape the sound
Adrenaline is surging, feet off the ground
Every clash, every strike, echoes in the night
In this cyber battle, we embrace the fight

Through the static and the noise
I can hear my inner voice
Saying "Don't you dare give up now"
This is where I make my vow

[FINAL CHORUS - 2:12-2:32]
Toxic duel, in the cyber light
Clashing forces, burning bright
Poison in the air, sparks ignite
Only one will stand when the circuits die
Toxic duel, we're fighting for our lives
In this neon world where the strong survive
Every move calculated, every strike precise
In this toxic duel, we test our might

[OUTRO - 2:32-2:45]
Neon lights dimming, silence in the air
One victor standing, the other in despair
In this toxic duel, legends are made
Cyberpunk warriors, in the neon shade
