Title: Show HN: Event-Driven Modding Platform for Pokemon Game (Beta Open)

I've been building a modding platform for a C# Pokemon game engine and
I'm opening up a beta program for developers.

The platform uses an event-driven architecture where mods subscribe to
game events (movement, collisions, tile interactions, etc.) and can
publish custom events for mod-to-mod communication.

Key features:
- Hot-reload (edit mods without restarting)
- ScriptBase API for clean mod structure
- Entity/tile filtering for performance
- Multi-script composition

Looking for 5-10 C# developers to help test. If interested, check out

Happy to answer questions!
